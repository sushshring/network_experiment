\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[numbers, sort&compress]{natbib}
% \usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
Co-resident cloud systems, despite their assurances, have always been vulnerable to direct and indirect attacks by malicious systems. Current cloud systems provide two options: either accept the status quo or pay more money for an isolated environment. The introduction of sophisticated cloud orchestration systems like Kubernetes have made it much easier to manage what application is running on what physical machine. In this paper, we demonstrate that despite cloud-provider security infrastructure, it is possible to prove co-residency or a victim container on state-of-the-art Kubernetes systems. However, each orchestrator generates enough noise in hardware access to affect co-residency detection and attacks. We define a measure for adversarial strength on such systems for a particular type of attack and compare the strength of adversaries against various orchestrators.

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{C}{loud} computing has grown exponentially in the last decade, growing to \$175 Billion in revenue in 2018 \cite{costello_gartner_2018}. The adoption of cloud computing has also grown to a large swath of industries including healthcare, finserv, technology, insurance, and more \cite{columbus_roundup_2018}. From small startups to large multi-national corporations, everyone seems to have some data on the cloud, a large portion of which can be highly sensitive. A major attack surface for customers of the cloud comes from having their code run on the same physical machine as a possible adversary (co-residency), leading to active privacy leaks. Despite the introduction of sophisticated management platforms such as Kubernetes, these threats still continue to exist. In light of Google's recent announcements \citet{citation_needed} for making clusters co-resident at the process isolation level rather than the virtual machine layer makes the work in this paper even more important. In this paper we will
\begin{itemize}
    \item Demonstrate based on work by \citet{bates_detecting_2012} how co-residency can still be an issue on modern cloud systems
    \item Define a measure of adversarial strength (platform resiliency) against co-residency detection and compare three major cloud orchestration platforms against such attacks
    \item Investigate the reason behind the disparities between such systems and propose solutions along those lines to improve resiliency against co-residency
%    \item Propose a new technique to manage security sensitive containers that will minimize the risk of a co-residency exploit based on work by \citet{azab_migrate:_2016}.
\end{itemize}
\section{Background} According to NIST \cite{mell_nist_2011}, cloud computing is defined as 
\begin{quote} ``a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction."
\end{quote}
\par Cloud service providers (CSP) such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform etc. provide certain services to their customers with a certain set of guarantees (service level agreements). While it is evident to customers that they are sharing the physical hardware with other customers, hereby referred to as tenants, the cloud platform also provides certain isolation guarantees for any code running on these systems. More specifically, Linux processes provide isolation guarantees that ensure that the memory in use is completely isolated from other processes. Access Control mechanisms in the operating system provide isolation at file and device levels. Similarly, hypervisors provide isolation to virtual machines running complete operating systems. More recently, containers are replacing virtual machines as the standard compute unit on the cloud. All of these isolation strategies have been proven to be vulnerable to various side-channel attacks \cite{yarom_flush+_2014} \cite{zhang_cross-tenant_2014} \cite{zhang_comprehensive_2016}.
\subsection{Threat model}
\par A co-resident attack considers an active, malicious adversary that has no affiliation to the cloud provider. The adversary appears as an innocuous tenant to the CSPs with no elevated privileges on the actual machine they are logged onto. They are free to launch as many instances on the cloud service as they want (barring some limits for specific CSP) and can choose the hardware configuration the instances will have. This hardware configuration is applied at the VM level, however, certain CSPs tend to restrict the type of VM instance that can be placed on a specific type of machine \cite{citation_needed}. This means that the adversary has the capability to choose from a subset of physical machines in some cases. For example, if an adversary decides to use \textbf{m2.large} instances on AWS, they will most likely be placed on machines specified for \textbf{m2.large} instances \cite{varadarajan_placement_nodate}. The adversary also has access to the standard interface for launching instances, same as the victim.
\par The victims are legitimate cloud tenants performing some security sensitive operations using hardware that is possibly shared with the adversary.  The victim has the same capabilities as the adversary when it comes to launching instances. Both members in this model trust the cloud provider and have little to no insight into the placement policies of the datacenter. Additionally, the adversary gains little to no information from metadata provided to the instance such as the IP address. While this information was useful in older attacks for cloud cartography \cite{ristenpart_hey_2009}, this is no longer viable on current cloud architectures.
\par Instead, the adversary aims to use one of the available side channels in order to gain unauthorized access to some information belonging to the victim. This information can range from knowledge of existence \cite{bates_detecting_2012}, \cite{ristenpart_hey_2009} to active attacks such as stealing private keys from cryptography applications \cite{zhang_cross-tenant_2014}. In this paper, we will use the watermarked network flow performance degradation side-channel to generate all our metrics.
\subsection{Container orchestrators}
\par A new type of isolation scheme at the process level is becoming the standard for running applications on cloud systems. This isolation makes use of Linux namespaces and other abstractions in order to virtualize process generation. Each process is made to believe that it is running on an independent machine with no interference, similar to a virtual machine. In order to mimic platform agnostic execution, all relevant libraries are bundled in to the process using a Layered File system (LayerFS) \citet{citation_needed}. All these facets are packaged into one "container" and can be run quite easily. Since it is only a process and all libraries are bundled into the application ahead of time, the spinup time for containers tends to be very low \citet{citation_needed}.
\par Modern cloud systems make use of containers running inside VM instances for fast launch, cross-platform compatibility, and security. More recently, large scale applications make use of containers to scale horizontally when demand rises. The fast spinup time makes for realtime and responsive scaling, as well as cost effective usage of compute resources. Additionally, more complicated applications can be broken into individual pieces called microservices which communicate with each other over the network. Each microservice can scale independently as the demand is generated without affecting its peers in any way.
\par Large scale applications are quickly adopting these strategies as it provides fast scaling, cost effectiveness, and lower downtimes due to rolling updates. In order to manage such architectures, there is a lot of work being put into applications that will manage the deployment of such microservices for very large use cases. These applications orchestrate the placement, scaling, and deployment of containers in a distributed setting providing capabilities to respond to large spikes in traffic and demand very quickly.
\par Sophisticated orchestration platforms to manage deployments using containers have opened the doors for more advanced container handling for cloud systems. Google's Borg project led to the development of Kubernetes \cite{verma_large-scale_2015} which helps automate the process of assigning containers to physical machines. In addition, the platform performs various additional virtualization at the compute, device, and network levels to simplify application development. While Kubernetes is still vulnerable to co-residency based attacks, it may be possible to enhance the abstractions developed with that platform to minimize the risk of co-residency attacks.


% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,

%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure

% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
